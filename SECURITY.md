# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently maintain the latest stable version of this project. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously in this project. If you discover a **vulnerability**, we strongly encourage you to report it in a responsible manner.

**Please open a [Security Advisory](/security/advisories/new) to report any vulnerabilities.**

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible. For confirmed vulnerabilities, we aim to provide a full **disclosure** and patch within **30 days**, depending on the complexity and impact.

**Please do not report security issues publicly before we have had a chance to investigate and address them.**

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** approach:
- You notify us privately of the issue.
- We confirm and fix the issue internally.
- A fix is released and a public **disclosure** is made (if necessary).

Thank you for helping us keep the project and our users safe.
